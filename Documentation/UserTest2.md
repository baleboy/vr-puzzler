## Questions - Part 1

### Can you describe what you see?

It seems to be the beginning of a game. I should press "Yes!" to continue

### OK, press it and tell me how you feel

Mmm, everything happens so fast, I wish I had more time to look at
this castle I'm entering

### I see, would you like the movement to be slower?

Yes, but also start from further back, I think it would be more
dramatic

### How did the movement make you feel?

It didn't bother me, it was so short.

## Questions - Part 2 (after updating the UI)

### How did the movement feel this time?

Now it was longer but also fast, I felt a bit dizzy at the end

## Conclusion

Based on the user's feedback, increased the length of the path towards
the play position, and made it a bit slower. The status of the UI at this point is recorded in [this video](https://youtu.be/03A7qW7Pt2E).
