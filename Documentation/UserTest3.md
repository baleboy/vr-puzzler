This was the final user test with the complete game.

Platform: iPhone6S with Google Cardboard

## Questions

### Welcome to the game. What do you think of the starting message?

Wizard's challenge, wow... Seems pretty clear, although the UI panel seems a bit off to the left (after checking, the reason was that I had started the game looking in a different direction). There, I started.

### How does the room look like?

It's fancy, especially the flames. The light is nice. But I couldn't really look around because the game started right away. Also, the grates on the floor look like they are wiggling (this was because of moiree effect - the
grates could be bigger but I decided to file it under "platform limitation")

### How would you describe the mood now?

Mysterious, scary, mainly because of the ominous music.

### What do you think of the movement when you win the game?

It's too fast, the moment I selected the last orb there was a
sound and I started to move. It would be more gratifying if there
would be a short pause. Also, the victory sound was too loud.

### What do you think of the orbs, how comfortable was it to select them?

It was easy and comfortable. Pressing the button is a bit uncomfortable,
but that's a hardware limitation.

## Conclusion

Based on Anna's feedback I made the wrong/success sounds quieter and
added a pause before moving to the reset position.
